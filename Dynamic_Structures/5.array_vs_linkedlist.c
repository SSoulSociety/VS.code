/*Arrays versus Linked Lists

• A linked list’s length can increase or decrease as necessary. Arrays are fixed-size.

• An array may contain more elements than needed, but this can waste memory.
Using linked lists can save memory, however, the pointers in a list’s nodes require
additional memory and memory allocation incurs the overhead of function calls.

• Fixed-size arrays can become full. Linked lists become full only when the system
has insufficient memory to satisfy dynamic storage-allocation requests.

• Linked lists can be maintained in sorted order by inserting each new element at
the appropriate point in the list. Inserting into and deleting from a sorted array
can be time-consuming—all elements following the inserted or deleted element
must be shifted appropriately.
